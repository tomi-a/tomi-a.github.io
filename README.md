# letsdevelop

This is a webpage to present a practice C# project.
See the associated Github Page. https://opafin.github.io/letsdevelop/

The page is based on a free Jekyll Theme that I've heavily modified to
Present a WebGL Unity build.

More info on the Jekyll Theme in "JekyllTheme" in the repository.
